**Paying your premium**

You must pay the premium (inclusive of all applicable taxes) monthly by Direct Debit. You must make regular payments in accordance with the 'Payments schedule' set out in your policy documentation. If we are unable to collect a payment from your bank we may attempt to request payment again unless you advise us otherwise.

We will collect the payment for the first month of the policy approximately two to four weeks after the start date. Payments for all subsequent months will be collected monthly on your selected payment date (or the next working day if a weekend or bank holiday). This means that the second payment may be collected approximately two weeks after the first payment.

We may use a collection agency to recover any amount owing to us. If you do not pay for your policy on time, it will be suspended from the due date. Any requests for repairs past this date will not be considered for approval unless payment is received.

The premium payable is fixed for the first year of cover. In the future it may increase. At the start of both the second and third year of cover, the monthly premium will increase by no more than £1. As a result the total premium payable for that year will increase by no more than £12, when compared to the previous year. Note, your premium may also increase by more than the amounts specified above as a result of a change in the taxes charged on insurance policies and over which we have no control.

If you have received any introductory discounts to the premium (e.g. half price for the first three months), any premium increase will be applied to the level of premium being paid after the introductory discount has ended. So if your premium for the first three months is half price, the increase will be based on the price you pay for months four to twelve. After the first three years the premium may increase at our discretion.

In all cases, we will write to you to give you 30 days' notice of any increase in the premium and you can notify us if you wish to cancel. The notice will show the new amount to pay.

**Duration of the policy**

For policies first purchased when your product is no longer protected by its manufacturer's guarantee there is a 30 day wait before the policy will start.

For all other policies, there is no wait period and the policy will begin once we process your application. Note, the 'start date' of your policy will be as specified in your certificate in your policy document. The policy continues indefinitely until cancelled or brought to an end in accordance with these terms and conditions.
You should review this cover periodically to ensure it remains adequate. We will contact you by post, telephone, email or SMS every 12 months to remind you of the benefits and cost of your protection.


**Fraudulent activity**

1.  We may provide your details to third parties in order to detect possible fraudulent activity.
2.  If we believe that you have (or anyone acting for you has) engaged in fraudulent activity against us or our service providers, or provided us with false information we may request extra information in support of your application or claim (such as proof of purchase).
3.  If we have reasonable grounds to believe that you have (or anyone acting for you has) made a claim under this policy knowing the claim to be dishonest, exaggerated or fraudulent, then we may:

    *   Decline your claim and immediately cancel your policy without any refund of premium or excess paid;
    *   Recover from you the cost of any claim already paid to you under this policy and the cost of any investigation into a fraudulent claim under this policy (and we may initiate legal proceedings to do so);
    *   Report you to the relevant authorities, including the police;
    *   Put the details of the fraudulent claim onto a register of claims through which insurers share information to prevent fraudulent claims. A list of participants names and addresses are available on request.
4.  If we have reasonable grounds to believe that you have (or anyone acting for you has):

    *   Engaged in fraudulent activity against us or our service providers; and/or
    *   Provided us with false information,

    with respect to another policy you hold or have held with us, we may cancel this policy as well as any other policies you have with us and/or reject any applications for new policies (see 'Our right to cancel your policy or bring it to an end' above). You will receive a refund of any premium paid for unused days of the policy.
