# Contributing to My Open RAG Project

First off, thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome all forms of participation: bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Create a new branch off `main` for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-feature
   ```
3. Install dependencies in a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Code your changes!

## Coding Guidelines

- **PEP 8** style guidelines for Python.
- Use **type hints** where possible.
- Add docstrings for classes and functions.
- Maintain **readability** and avoid complexity.

## Testing

- If you add new features or fix bugs, please add tests if possible.
- (Optional) We plan to add a `tests/` folder. For now, you can add a simple script in `tests/`.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code merges cleanly with the latest `main`.
2. Open a Pull Request (PR) and describe your changes.
3. A maintainer will review and request changes if needed.

Thank you for helping make this project better!
